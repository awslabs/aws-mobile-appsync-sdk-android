## [Release 3.0.0](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mobile-appsync-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v3.0.0)

### Enhancements
* Added support for connecting to AWS AppSync using pure WebSockets for GraphQL subscriptions.
  * Selection set filtering will be done per client as each client can define their own selection set. 
    In this case the subscription selection set must be a subset of the mutation selection set. For example, 
    a subscription `addedPost{author title}` linked to the mutation `addPost(...){id author title url version}` 
    would receive only the author and the title of the post and none of the other fields. 
    However, if the mutation didn't have the author in its selection set the subscriber would get a `null` 
    value for the author field (or an error in case the author field is defined as required/not-null in the schema).
  * In the earlier SDK version, if you didn’t configure the associated subscription selection set with the required fields 
    and relied on the mutation fields to push data to subscribed client, the behavior will change when you move to this version  
    that use pure WebSockets. In the example above, a subscription without the "author" field defined in its selection set 
    would still return the author name with MQTT over WebSockets as the field is defined in the mutation, the same behavior 
    won’t apply for pure WebSockets. The subscription selection set is essential when using pure WebSockets: if a field is
    not explicitly defined in the subscription it won't be returned by AWS AppSync.
    
* Adopted Semantic versioning
  * Starting with version 3.0.0 AppSync AWS Android SDK will follow [sematic versioning](https://semver.org/).

### Misc. Updates
* `AWSAppSync` now depends on `AWSCore` version `2.16.3` instead of `2.16.1`.

## [Release 2.10.1](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mobile-appsync-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.10.1)

## Enhancements
* Make `GraphQLStoreOperation.Callback` a public interface, so the `AWSAppSyncStore` asyncrhonous operations can be passed with a callback. Thanks @cjami for the contribution. See [PR #193](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mobile-appsync-sdk-android/pull/193) for details.

### Misc. Updates
* `AWSAppSync` now depends on `AWSCore` version `2.16.1` instead of `2.13.5`.

### Bug Fixes
* If an App Sync subscription attempts to be executed while in a non-Idle state, it will now pass the error back through the callback vs. crashing the app with a runtime exception. See [issue#202](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mobile-appsync-sdk-android/issues/202)

## [Release 2.10.0](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mobile-appsync-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.10.0)

## Enhancements
* Add new validations in `AWSAppSyncClient.Builder`.
  * Throw `RuntimeException` when Android context passed in is null.
  * Throw `RuntimException` when there is no valid `AuthMode` object passed in.

### Misc. Updates
* `AWSAppSync` now depends on `AWSCore` version `2.13.5` instead of `2.13.4`.

## [Release 2.9.0](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mobile-appsync-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.9.0)

## New Features
* Support multiple authorization modes for a single AWS AppSync GraphQL endpoint.
* Introduced `clientDatabasePrefix(String)` that accepts a prefix that will be used in the construction of database name for caching query responses, offline mutations and subscriptions metadata. The usage of the prefix can be enabled by the flag `useClientDatabasePrefix(true)`. When the prefix is used, the name of the database would look as follows:

Purpose of cache | No prefix | Valid prefix
--- | --- | ---
Query responses | `appsyncstore` | `<ClientDatabasePrefix>_appsyncstore`
Offline Mutations | `appsyncstore_mutation` | `<ClientDatabasePrefix>_appsyncstore_mutation`
Subscriptions metadata for Delta Sync | `appsync_deltasync_db` | `<ClientDatabasePrefix>_appsync_deltasync_db`

  * The `ClientDatabasePrefix` can be passed via `awsconfiguration.json` that is generated from the AWS AppSync Console and Amplify CLI.

      ```
	     "AppSync": {
		    "Default": {
		      "ApiUrl": "https://xyz.appsync-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/graphql",
		      "Region": "us-east-2",
		      "AuthMode": "API_KEY",
		      "ApiKey": "da2-xyz",
		      "ClientDatabasePrefix": "MyAppSyncAPIName_API_KEY"
		    }
		  }
	   ```
	  
	  The `AWSAppSyncClient` object can be constructed as follows:
	  ```java
		  AWSAppSyncClient awsAppSyncClient = AWSAppSyncClient.builder()
	                .awsConfiguration(awsConfiguration)
	                .useClientDatabasePrefix(true)
	                .build();
     ```
    
  * Alternatively, the `ClientDatabasePrefix` can be passed via the `AWSAppSyncClient.Builder`.
      ```java
	     AWSAppSyncClient awsAppSyncClient = AWSAppSyncClient.builder()
	                    .context(getApplicationContext())
	                    .apiKey(new BasicAPIKeyAuthProvider("da2-apiKey"))
	                    .serverUrl(serverUrl)
	                    .region(region)
	                    .useClientDatabasePrefix(true)
	                    .clientDatabasePrefix("MyAppSyncAPIName_API_KEY")
	                    .build();
      ```

### Misc. Updates
* `AWSAppSync` now depends on `AWSCore` version `2.13.4` instead of `2.13.2`.

[cacheKey](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mobile-appsync-sdk-android/pull/143/files#diff-3b667778e3f6cc993de08b4e7459c329) method from ResponseField is no longer used to compute the cache key and is being deleted. [CacheFieldValueResolver](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mobile-appsync-sdk-android/pull/143/files#diff-0b41556c1e8c6bd843aafff408e59f1d) now accepts an instance of [CacheKeyBuilder](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mobile-appsync-sdk-android/pull/143/files#diff-e329cc0b9923fb69cc28ea780b055493) which is used to compute cache keys instead of the cacheKey method. See [issue #103](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mobile-appsync-sdk-android/issues/103)

### New Features
* Added support for Delta Sync Feature
    Delta Sync allows you to perform automatic synchronization with an AWS AppSync GraphQL server.
